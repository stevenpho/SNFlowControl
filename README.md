## 📦 Installation

### CocoaPods

```ruby
pod 'SNFlowControl'
```

### 🚀 Usage
```swift
import SNFlowControl

func example1() {
    SNFlowControl {
        SNAction { context in
            print("step1")
            context(.onNext)
        }

        SNAction.log("record")

        SNAction.then(onQueue: .none) {
            print("do stuff")
        }

        SNAction.delay(onQueue: .main(createStyle: .none), seconds: 3)

        SNAction.log("after delay 3 seconds")

        SNAction.if {
            return true
        }

        SNAction { context in
            DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 3) {
                context(.onNext)
            }
        }

        SNAction.log("wait until async action finished")

    } finished: {
        print("flow control end")
    }.start()
}
```
